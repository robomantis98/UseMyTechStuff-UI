                    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
                        <p>DJs require high-end music products to perform. My research showed that DJ gear can cost up to $2000 at a minimum. With an app like Use My Tech Stuff, people will be able to rent high-end tech products such as music equipment so that they can perform better at their jobs. In researching the attributes and goals of DJs, most forums explained that the main focus of DJs is to create exciting music which is only possible if they have the right DJ gear.</p>

                        <p>Volara is the expert in voice-automated hotel guest engagement. They offer hospitality industry partners a full-service solution. Hotels rely on their expertise to provide a truly seamless and extraordinary guest experience! Volara 
                        decided that the experience they were going for this time, would be Virtual Reality to compliment their voice automated engagement. This event brought people to other places that the hospitality chain operated in using cameras and other equipment for a mix of VR and AR. So Volara decided to rent VR headets and camera recording equipment from Use My Tech Stuff to make the event a reality.
